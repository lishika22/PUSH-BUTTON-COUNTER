*DISCRIPTION*: A Push Button Counter is an introductory embedded systems project that utilizes a microcontroller, typically the Arduino Uno or Nano, to count the number of times a user presses a push button. This project uses basic electronic components such as push buttons, resistors (usually 10kÎ© for pull-down configuration), jumper wires, and optional display devices like a 16x2 LCD, 7-segment display, or the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE. The main tool for writing and uploading code is the Arduino IDE, which supports C/C++-based programming and provides built-in serial communication features to display output. If a simulation is required before hardware testing, software like Proteus Design Suite or Tinkercad Circuits is commonly used to simulate the circuit and verify the logic. In Proteus, users can add virtual components like the Arduino, push buttons, and displays to test functionality in a controlled virtual environment. The working principle is simple: when the button is pressed, the Arduino reads a HIGH signal on a digital input pin and increments a counter variable; the result is displayed in real time. The project also integrates software debouncing logic to prevent errors from signal noise caused by mechanical bouncing of the push button. Through this project, students and hobbyists learn essential topics such as digital input detection, serial communication, display interfacing, basic circuit design, and microcontroller programming. It also provides a foundation for building more advanced systems like keypad inputs, digital counters, and automation interfaces.
